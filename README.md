A very, super simple node application (*scaffolding*) equipped with Babel for Node. This scaffolding has no frontend integration but is great for creating Node app (starter files) on the fly. Actually, if you're planning on creating
**API** server, this repo is the place to start. However, if you really want to quickly use a template for your API you can use my **Clean-Rest-API** repo [here](https://github.com/MelodicCrypter/clean-rest-api). Just edit a few files, setup your own
.env file and you're good to go. You can also check my **Robust Node Scaffolding** git repo [here](https://github.com/MelodicCrypter/Robust-Node-Scaffolding) for a more sophisticated setup or my **Noder Scaffolding** [here](https://github.com/MelodicCrypter/Noder-Scaffolding)
if you want a minimal setup but with frontend stuff, like Bootstrap, already implemented. By the way, this scaffolding has already been modified to be deployed in **Heroku** with no issues.
